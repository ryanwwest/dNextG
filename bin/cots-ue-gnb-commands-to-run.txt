replace docker_compose/oai_db2.sql with etc/ version (because adds the COTS UE subscriptions)

the ota-nuc#-cots-ue 'Startup' column failues "Exit (126)" aren't actually an issue, just a file permissions thing. Doesn't affect output. 

for node-1 (real gnb):
- Need to fix the interface link between node-1 (or computer that controls real gNB) and ota-x310-1-gnb-sdr because ota-x310-1-gnb-sdr uses only IP address 192.168.40.2. The network interface subnet is 10.10.2.1 by default but should be changed with: "sudo ifconfig eno2 192.168.40.1  netmask 255.255.255.0". After that, you can ping the radio to test connectivity.
- can look for problems with command uhd_usrp_probe
- for real gnb use: "sudo /var/tmp/oairan/cmake_targets/ran_build/build/nr-softmodem -E   -O /local/repository/etc/gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.usrpx310.conf --sa", but first you have to change to appropriate interface TODO make
- the UHD driver was messed up on 3.15 instead of UHD4, but it piped out 2 commands you have to run to fix this. It then requires power-cycling the sdr on the powder UI, but all these instructions are stated. After this, it works.
- have to run "sudo ifconfig eno2 mtu 9000" but with the right iface as a startup script is currently misconfigured and adjusts mtu for the other interface to cn, not to sdr. This should be fixed to stop needing to do this.


for cots-ue (ota-nuc1-cots-ue):
- first use AT commands to switch device between airplane mode / connecitivity on with `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2` and then type "at+cfun=1" and enter for on, and =4 for airplane mode (need to do this repeatedly in order to more quickly reconnect with gnb, though it auto connects either way eventually)
- then can run sudo quectel-CM -s oai -4 to start connection manager which will create a network interface if PDU session successful.


MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVERWRITE cp.yaml and upf.yaml if restarting them as had to mess with sst, sd in both of them to get things working.
